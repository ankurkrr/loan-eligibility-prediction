MODEL BUILDING

Steps --
1. Import train and test data
2. Fill in Missing Data using mean and mode
3. Reduce Skewness of Data using natural logarithm
4. Encode Independent categorical data using Label encoder
5. Scaling and removing outliers of the data using Standard scaler
6. Train the model on Decision tree algorithm and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier algorithm
7. Gaussian Naive Bayes has more accuracy compared to Decision tree
8. Test the model on testing data
